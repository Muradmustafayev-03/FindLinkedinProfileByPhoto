# FindLinkedinProfileByPhoto

Imagine that you are at a tech conference, taking pictures / selfies with people you meet during the event. Now, imagine that you look at the picture and tap on the person on that photo and you donâ€™t remember his name or his contact details. This program implements face detection and recognition to find a linkedin profile of a person by photo.

## How to run
*Recommended to run on Linux.*

_**Note:** the program uses `dlib` library, that relies on `c++` code, which would require `Visual Studio Build Tools` installed on your machine if you want to run it on Windows._

### To run the program, proceed the following steps:
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal
3. Create a `secret.py` file with 2 constants:
   * `USERNAME` (str) - your LinkedIn username
   * `PASSWORD` (str) - your LinkedIn password

   *__Note:__ Indeed, these constants can also be declared in the `main.py` file of the client folder*

4. In the `main.py` file of the client folder specify the path to your photo and other parameters
5. Run `python -m server.api.main.py` to start the server
6. Run `python -m client.main.py` to send request from the client
7. Wait for the response

## Parameters
* **keywords** - a string with space-separated keywords to narrow the range of the search down. Recommended to specify as many known details as possible to make the search quicker. **WARNING:** Do not put commas, separate keywords with spaces.
* **chunk_size** - number of profiles to be processed in a single request. For now, as there is no authentication system, so the back-end does not remember the offset and the progress for the previous request is not saved for the next one (implies that you have to assign larger values). In future, the authentication system will be added, so you can assign smaller values and run requests several times.
* **threshold** - threshold for the face recognition model. Float from 0 to 1.
